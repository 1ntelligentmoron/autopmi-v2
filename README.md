# 1ntelligentMoron's AutoPMI V2
Version 1 has reached EOL since full-day school resumption in Oct 2021.

# What does this app do?
AutoPMI is a tool for Logos IB M23 Cohort (i.e. 21-22 MS3) students to join Zoom lessons automatically, discarding the need to look up which teacher's class to join, finding the teacher's PMI, and entering the PMI in Zoom. Contact me through any means if you have problems.

# Programme Requirements
A functioning computer that isn't a potato.

# Setup Guide
(TBC)
